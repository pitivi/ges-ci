    oggdemux: check for full eos after a pad goes eos in push mode
    
    After a pad is on EOS, verify if all pads are EOS and return
    upstream, avoiding keeping the buffer flow without having more
    data to push

    oggdemux: properly handle stop position at seeks in push mode
    
    Store the seek stop and seqnum and properly restore them when
    receiving the corresponding Segment from upstream. Also fixes
    seqnum for converted seek events.

    matroskademux: Preserve seqnum when pushing seek upstream
    
    After converting a seek from time to bytes, use the same seqnum
    on the event that goes upstream

    qtdemux: track streams that are EOS on push mode to finish earlier
    
    When the segment has a defined stop position, qtdemux should check
    when streams reach this position and mark those as EOS. When all
    streams are EOS it will return GST_FLOW_EOS to upstream to allow
    the pipeline to finish instead of continuously consume buffers
    from upstream that are not useful for the segment.

    qtdemux: preserve stop of segment when doing seeks in push mode
    
    When handling seeks in push mode, qtdemux converts the seek to bytes
    and pushes upstream. It needs to keep track of the seek and the
    subsequent segment to be able to map them back to the requested
    seek time and properly preserve the segment stop of the seek.
    
    This is done by using the start offset in bytes of the seek,
    that should be the same of the segment from upstream. And this
    is also backwards compatible with what qtdemux already was using.

    Pass the seqnum to other events that are consequence of the
    original seek event
