    videoconvert: fix handling of chroma resample
    
    Increase the number of temporary lines that we need, it is possible that the
    up and downsampling offsets are out of phase and that we need to keep some
    extra lines around. Also copy the unhandled output lines for the next round
    instead of overwriting them.
