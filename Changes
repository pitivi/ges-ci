    basesrc: preserve seqnum on segments after seeks
    
    The seqnum of the segment after a seek should be the same of
    the seek event. Downstream elements might rely on seqnums to
    identify events related to a seek.
    
    This is particularly important when a demuxer maps a TIME seek
    into a BYTES seek for upstream and it needs to identify the
    corresponding segment event and map it back into TIME to push
    downstream, possibly using the values from the original seek
    event.
