    udpsrc: Bind to multicast addresses on non-Windows systems
    
    On Windows it's not possible to bind to a multicast address
    but the OS will make sure to filter out all packets that
    arrive not for the multicast address the socket joined.
    
    On Linux and others it is necessary to bind to a multicast
    address to let the OS filter out all packets that are received
    on the same port but for different addresses than the multicast
    address
    
    And deprecate the multicast-group property and replace it with the
    address property.
