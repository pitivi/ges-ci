    eglglessink: change pool->sink->last_buffer to pool->last_buffer
    
    So that GstEGLImageBufferPool does not depend on GstEglGlesSink
    The goal is still to move it into gstegl lib

    eglglessink: buffer pool does not need to maintain a ref on the display
    
    Because it does not use it and also it may not know it when
    we create the pool

    eglglessink: add GstEGLImageBufferPoolSendBlockingAllocate callback
    
    The goal here is to prepare GstEGLBufferPool to be moved into
    gstegl lib. So it has to not depend on 'gst_eglglessink_queue_object'

    eglglessink: prepare gst_egl_adaptation_allocate_eglimage to be moved
    
    into gstegl lib or splited between gstegl lib and gstgl lib
    because it both depends on egl and gl
    
    So it has to not depend on GstEglAdaptationContext
